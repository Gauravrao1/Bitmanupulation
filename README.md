# Bitwise Operators ðŸ”¢

This project demonstrates the use of **bitwise operators** in programming with simple examples.  
Bitwise operators allow direct manipulation of bits, making programs **faster and memory efficient**.

## ðŸ“Œ Bitwise Operators Covered

1. **AND (`&`)** â†’ Sets each bit to `1` if both bits are `1`.  
   Example: `5 & 3 = 1`

2. **OR (`|`)** â†’ Sets each bit to `1` if at least one bit is `1`.  
   Example: `5 | 3 = 7`

3. **XOR (`^`)** â†’ Sets each bit to `1` if only one of the bits is `1`.  
   Example: `5 ^ 3 = 6`

4. **NOT (`~`)** â†’ Inverts all the bits.  
   Example: `~5 = -6` (in 2â€™s complement representation)

5. **Left Shift (`<<`)** â†’ Shifts bits to the left, filling zeros from the right.  
   Example: `5 << 1 = 10`

6. **Right Shift (`>>`)** â†’ Shifts bits to the right, discarding shifted bits.  
   Example: `5 >> 1 = 2`
